# Fashionstore-SRS-SDS

For our Fashion Store E-commerce website, we created a Software Requirement and Design specifications report as part of the documentation. It included the project scope, constraints, functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, design strategy, along with diagrams such as the class diagram, ECB diagram, ER diagram, sequence diagram, use case diagram, state diagram, activity diagram, component and deployment diagram. This came in handy while analysing the viability of our idea and helped us learn business analysis skills.
